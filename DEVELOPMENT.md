# Development Plan

## Test-Driven Development Approach

### Why TDD for Agentic CLI?

1. **Security Critical**: File system operations and code generation require bulletproof validation
2. **Complex Integrations**: LLM providers, sandboxing, and CLI interactions need isolated testing
3. **User Safety**: Every component that touches user code must be thoroughly tested
4. **Rapid Iteration**: TDD enables confident refactoring as requirements evolve

### TDD Methodology

```
Red → Green → Refactor → Integrate
```

**Red**: Write failing tests that define expected behavior
**Green**: Write minimal code to make tests pass  
**Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green
**Integrate**: Ensure components work together correctly

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests (70%)
- Individual CLI commands and argument parsing
- Task template parsing and validation
- File system sandbox operations
- LLM provider interfaces (mocked)
- Security validation functions

#### Integration Tests (25%)
- End-to-end CLI workflows
- Agent coordination and state management
- File system operations with real sandbox
- Configuration management across components

#### System Tests (5%)
- Full user workflows from CLI to applied changes
- Performance under various project sizes
- Error handling and recovery scenarios
- Security boundary validation

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

#### Week 1: CLI Framework
**Objective**: Basic command structure and configuration

**Tests to Write First**:
```python
def test_cli_init_creates_config_file():
    # Should create .agentic/config.yaml with defaults

def test_cli_generate_requires_task_description():
    # Should fail with helpful error if no task provided

def test_config_get_returns_current_values():
    # Should return configured values or sensible defaults
```

**Implementation Goals**:
- [ ] CLI argument parsing with Click/Typer
- [ ] Configuration management with YAML
- [ ] Basic error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Help system and command documentation

#### Week 2: Task Template System
**Objective**: Parse and validate structured task definitions

**Tests to Write First**:
```python
def test_task_template_validates_required_fields():
    # Should reject templates missing required fields

def test_task_template_substitutes_variables():
    # Should replace {variable} with user inputs

def test_task_registry_loads_builtin_tasks():
    # Should find and load built-in task definitions
```

**Implementation Goals**:
- [ ] YAML-based task template parsing
- [ ] Input validation and schema checking
- [ ] Variable substitution system
- [ ] Built-in task library structure

#### Week 3: File System Sandbox  
**Objective**: Safe file operations with preview/apply workflow

**Tests to Write First**:
```python
def test_sandbox_isolates_generated_files():
    # Generated files should only appear in .agentic/preview/

def test_apply_moves_files_to_correct_locations():
    # Should move files from preview to target locations

def test_sandbox_prevents_directory_traversal():
    # Should reject paths like ../../etc/passwd
```

**Implementation Goals**:
- [ ] Sandbox directory creation and management
- [ ] Safe file path validation
- [ ] Preview/apply workflow implementation
- [ ] File conflict detection and resolution

#### Week 4: Basic Generator Agent
**Objective**: LLM integration with simple code generation

**Tests to Write First**:
```python
def test_generator_creates_valid_python_code():
    # Should generate syntactically correct Python

def test_generator_uses_task_template_context():
    # Should incorporate template variables and context

def test_generator_handles_llm_provider_errors():
    # Should gracefully handle API failures
```

**Implementation Goals**:
- [ ] LLM provider abstraction layer
- [ ] Basic prompt template system
- [ ] Code generation pipeline
- [ ] Output validation and sanitization

### Phase 2: Enhanced Capabilities (Weeks 5-8)

#### Week 5-6: Context Management
**Objective**: Project-aware code generation

**Tests to Write First**:
```python
def test_context_engine_indexes_project_files():
    # Should create searchable index of project structure

def test_context_retrieval_finds_relevant_files():
    # Should return relevant files for given task

def test_context_respects_gitignore_patterns():
    # Should exclude files matching .gitignore
```

#### Week 7-8: Review Agent
**Objective**: Automated code quality validation

**Tests to Write First**:
```python
def test_reviewer_detects_syntax_errors():
    # Should identify and report syntax issues

def test_reviewer_runs_configured_linters():
    # Should execute project-specific quality tools

def test_reviewer_generates_improvement_suggestions():
    # Should provide actionable feedback
```

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (Weeks 9-12)

#### Week 9-10: Advanced Workflows
- Multi-step task coordination
- Dependency management between generated files
- Rollback and undo capabilities

#### Week 11-12: Polish & Optimization
- Performance optimization
- Error message improvement
- Documentation and examples
- Beta user testing

- `agentic --help` shows all available commands
- `agentic init` creates working configuration
- `agentic config get/set` manages settings
- All commands provide helpful error messages

**Test Coverage Target**: >90% for CLI module

### PoC 2: Task Template System (Week 2)
**Success Criteria**:

- Handle template errors gracefully

**Test Coverage Target**: >95% for template parsing

### PoC 3: Sandbox Operations (Week 3)

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Python 3.11+ with development tools
python -m pip install poetry pytest pytest-cov black ruff mypy

# Development dependencies
poetry install --with dev,test

# Pre-commit hooks for code quality
pre-commit install
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
pytest --cov=agentic --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/unit/          # Unit tests only
pytest tests/integration/   # Integration tests
pytest tests/system/        # Full system tests

# Run tests in watch mode during development
pytest-watch
```

### Quality Gates
Every commit must pass:
- [ ] All tests passing (>95% coverage)
- [ ] Type checking with mypy
- [ ] Code formatting with black
- [ ] Linting with ruff
- [ ] Security scan with bandit

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **LLM Provider Reliability**: Mock all external APIs, test offline fallbacks
2. **File System Security**: Extensive path validation tests, sandbox escape attempts
3. **Code Quality**: Multiple validation layers, conservative defaults
4. **Performance**: Benchmark tests for large projects, timeout handling

### Development Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Strict MVP boundaries, defer non-essential features
2. **Over-Engineering**: Simple solutions first, refactor when needed
3. **Test Debt**: Maintain >90% coverage, TDD discipline
4. **User Validation**: Weekly check-ins with target users

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Test coverage >90% (>95% for security-critical code)
- All PoCs completed on schedule
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Performance targets met for typical projects

### User Metrics
- Time from install to first working generation <5 minutes
- Task success rate >80% for common use cases
- User satisfaction >7/10 in beta testing
- Clear path to production deployment

**Next Steps**: Begin with PoC 1 (CLI Framework) following strict TDD methodology. Each feature starts with failing tests that define the expected behavior.
